# System test case 0000

| UID | Title |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0000 | Instantiate default objects using the popup menu |


**Description (User must be able to...)**

Instantiate default objects in the graph using the popup menu. One object of each kind must be created:

- a text block
- a redirect node
- a data node
- an operation node (labeled "Common operations" in the popup menu)
- a built-in node
- a standard library node
- a general viewer node
- a pygame-ce node
- a snippet node (labeled "Encapsulation" in the popup menu)


**Steps**

1. perform the following steps once for each kind of object:
    1. right-click an empty spot on the screen/canvas
    1. in the popup menu that appears, select one kind of object and click a command to add it


**Assertions**

After performing the steps, one object of each kind must be stored in the corresponding collections, so check both the quantity (there must be one for each kind of object) and quality (each object must be of a specific kind).
